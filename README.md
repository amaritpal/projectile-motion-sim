This projectile motion simulator was designed to provide an interactive and educational experience, allowing users to explore and understand the principles of projectile motion in a dynamic and visually engaging way. The simulator breaks down complex physics concepts into manageable components by enabling users to control input variables, such as initial velocity and launch angle, and to observe the resulting trajectory and associated statistics. Each element in the interface and structure was selected to optimize user experience, deepen understanding, and maintain transparency regarding the simulator's development process.â€‹
